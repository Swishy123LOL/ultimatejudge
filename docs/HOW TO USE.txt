Only run judge.exe! compiler.exe and executor.exe are meant to be used only when running judge.exe!

To run judge.exe, you first need to set some flags. Here are all the flags you MUST set before running:

-i: Source code path
-o: Program destination path
-t: Time limit (milliseconds)
-m: Memory limit (bytes)
-tj: testinfo.json path

Example usage: .\judge -i test.cpp -o test.exe -t 500 -m 1073741824 -tj .\testcase\testinfo.json

testinfo.json is used to locate all the test input and output files, as well as other information for the judge to handle these tests. You MUST set it before running judge.exe!!!

You can manually set testinfo.json or use testinfogen.exe. To do this, first place testinfogen.exe (located in .../testcase) in the directory of the tests you want to add. Then run it, and testinfogen.exe will convert all files with the extensions .in and .out to input and output files.
